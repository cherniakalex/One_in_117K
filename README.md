# 🧬 One_in_117K — The Friday Family Mystery

**One_in_117K** is a playful and interactive React app that reveals an extraordinary coincidence:  
> Every member of one family — parents, two kids, a dog, and a cat — was born on a **Friday**.  
> The chance of that? Just **1 in 117,649**!

This project uses animation, avatars, and probability to create a light-hearted experience for exploring family birthdays.
